# week-1-code-refactor
homework week 1


# Description 
I have wrote this code to show the importance of accessibility. Having good accessibility means code will be able to be readable and also easy maintain. I have learnt while refactoring code the importance of semantic HTML elements, keeping styling seperate and also attributes for icons and images for people with disabilities.
